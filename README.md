# Triangulizer


Upload an mp4 file to triangulize it. 

Triangulizer breaks up the uploaded video into individual frames, applies a [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) on each frame, and then assembles the frames back together into a video. After the transformation is complete, you can view the triangulized video in comparison to the original.

A video demo can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AZHZsI5fnc).
